# nyc-cam

Makes use of https://webcams.nyctmc.org cataloged in the static
config.json. I prefer the dashboard UI style. I also like the
boundaries, search, and grouping. And when you have one cam up, you
can specify all other cams within 100, 400, or 1000 yards of that
cam. It just feels better than a hunt-and-peck style.


## To Do

Fix the leafletJS bug when resizing the window. It freaks the map
out. I tried to stamp it out in a few ways but no luck so far. I had
suspected something odd with the lat/lon vs lon/lat but don't see it.
